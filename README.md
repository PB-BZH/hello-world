Professor at the University of Western Brittany (UBO) at the University Technological Institute (IUT) in electrical engineering and industrial computer science.
I teach and master many programming languages for over 20 years from the most basic (ASM / C) to the most complex such as C #, Java, Ruby, PHP object, HTML.
Like many technologists, I keep myself up to date with new technologies and their applications.
